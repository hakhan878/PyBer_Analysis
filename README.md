# Overview of PyBer Analysis
## What is the purpose of this analysis?
 - In this analysis, we examined various parameters of public transportation within cities such as fees, quantities of rides, and quantities of drivers per city type (Rural, Suburban, Urban). The purpose of this exercise is to parse the data into observable and significant information from which we may draw conclusions.
 
## Results
 - Urban cities had the most rides, while rural had the least. 
 - Rural areas had the least amount of drivers at around 500; suburbs had over ten times the amount of drivers as rural areas, and the number of drivers in urban cities was drastically higher at close to 60,000 drivers. 
 - Urban cities had the greatest total fares at around $40,000, suburbs close to $20,000, and rural areas at around $4,300. 
 - Average fare per ride saw a significant difference between city types with rural rides averaging the highest fare per ride ($34.62) and urban rides averaging the lowest ($24.53). The difference in averages between rural rides and suburban rides was approximately $4, and that between suburban and urban was over $6. 
 - Fares per driver, predictably from these trends, were drastically higher in rural locations than in suburban or urban locations.
 
 ## Summary
  - When contemplating courses of action to change any disparities between city types, it is important to identify which factors cannot be changed. For instance, rides in rural areas may be longer due to a greater distance between separate destinations. Or, fares per driver are expected to be lower in the city, where there are bound to be more drivers than in less-populated areas.
  - To increase the fare per driver in urban cities, one of two things must happen: either we can increase the cost of a ride per distance (for instance, a ride of equal distance will cost more in an urban city than in a rural location), or we can be more selective about which drivers are allowed to work (thereby decreasing the number of drivers).
  - Fares per driver in rural areas are comparatively comfortable; therefore, we may want to increase the demand of rides and drivers in rural areas through hosting events or other developments.
  - By encouraging travel between different city types, we may be able to ease the magnitude of their disparities.
